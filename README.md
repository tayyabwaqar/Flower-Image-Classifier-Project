# Flower-Image-Classifier-Project
Developing an AI Application for flower classification using image recognition


# Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI application capable of classifying images of flowers into different species. As AI becomes increasingly integrated into everyday applications, this project serves as a practical example of how deep learning models can be used as integral components of software solutions. Imagine a smartphone app that identifies flowers using the cameraâ€”this project lays the foundation for such an application.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of 102 flower categories, provided by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford. This diverse dataset allows the model to learn and distinguish between various flower species.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into several key steps:
Load and Preprocess the Dataset: Prepare the image data for training by applying necessary transformations and augmentations.
Train the Image Classifier: Develop and train a deep learning model to recognize different flower species using the preprocessed dataset.
Predict Image Content: Utilize the trained classifier to predict the species of flowers in new images.

# Implementation
The project is implemented in Python, guiding you through each step of the process. By the end of the project, you'll have a command-line application capable of being trained on any labeled image dataset. This provides a versatile foundation for building applications that can identify objects beyond flowers, such as cars or animals.
